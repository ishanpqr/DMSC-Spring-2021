## Algorithmic Walk

_Repeat 5 times {

 Go down street
 
 At intersection turn Random
 
if encounter a dead end go back to last intersection and execute random function

}

Random {

 random 2 (flip a coin)
 
 if 1(heads): go down street with least number of cars within vision
 
 if 2(tails): go down street with least amount of snow
 
}_

I am going to start with the Random function. While I was leaving home, I reached into my pocket and I realized that I had a coin with me so to make things interesting I introduced it my random function. Since it was snowing, and some streets were clear, and some were not I thought it was a good deciding factor to where I go. Since I hate it when people park their cars on the road, I decided to give me a chance to go down streets which have the least number of cars. With those two in mind, I started on algorithmic walk.
When I started my walk it just stopped snowing so I the sky was completely white which looked nice with the bare trees adding a nice plain aesthetic. When I reached the second intersection the random function decided to send me towards the dead end to counter that I added the if statement to my walk in which I would go back to the last intersection and flip my coin again and choose another street.
During my walk I saw a lot of people shoveling their snow, so I greeted a bunch of people and had a lot of small talk with different people and the best part was that there were not many cars on the road. I continued my path and luckily never repeated any street and ended up near a park with a lake near my house where I sat down and spent the rest of my day on the bench sipping some hot coffee, I brought along with me.
As for another person’s walk, two days later I tried the professor’s walk with the random function literally being something interesting. At every intersection I stopped and looked for something interesting at every turn. For example, at my first intersection I saw a little snowman near someone’s yard, so I picked that street and got a better look at the snowman and funnily enough after couple of turns I ended up at the same lake park luckily.
