## First class and experience with LOGO

Discussed the fundamentals of how art and code mix to create fascinating images. We started delving into this topic by exploring a little bit of LOGO. LOGO is a very clunky language used to make various images. In a good way it lacks the intimidation of other programming languages and has simple straight forward commands which can produces interesting images. Coming from Tokyo I always have an eye for neon images on dark backgrounds, so I started my LOGO code by creating a very rudimentary colorful lines on the black background.

After this I tried to refine this image and tried to create object and made something that looked like a pair of eyes.

Overall, my experience with LOGO was fun and I would like to create more colorful and cool images like the ones I made before with the help of functions and other advanced commands.
