## Experience

I grouped up with 5 other people for this session. I initially thought it would be chaotic and it would take us a very long time to match up each others tune but 3 minutes in we already had something nice.

	fast 2 $ sound "[[hh:5*5,cp*0.5,arpy:10*0.5], [mt*0.5]] drum [drum,arpy:10*5] drum:10*2" 
    
This was my main tune but to add to this I started messing with the stack function and that was when I found out that estuary provides you with small snippets of code which make interesting sounds so I started using those snippets along with my main tune and combined them with the help of the stack function.
