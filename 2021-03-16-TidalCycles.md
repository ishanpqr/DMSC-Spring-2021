## Experience

I grouped up with 5 other people for this session. I initially thought it would be chaotic and it would take us a very long time to match up each others tune but 3 minutes in we already had something nice.

``` fast 2 $ sound "[[hh:5*5,cp*0.5,arpy:10*0.5], [mt*0.5]] drum [drum,arpy:10*5] drum:10*2" 

```
