## Squirrel Game - Generating Background and random Objects within 

I was tasked the job too generate the background and randomnly place environmental objects (Grass, Flowers) on the background.

Before going into the implementions I wanted to talk about the challenges of randomly placing things. When you use the random function, your objects tend to cluster together and to avoid that I tweaked how my random values would work.
