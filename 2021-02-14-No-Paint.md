## Opinions

I think of No Paint as a tool that I am using to make digital art. I believe that No Paint falls under the same category as Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.. So when i make something in No Paint I like to think of it as my art mainly because I was the one who put those random images together to ake something meaningfull out of them. To simply think of it, when you want to make a simple house in MS Paint you use the rectangles and triangles tool to combine them to make a house similarly in No Paint I was given random images and I put them together and created something.
