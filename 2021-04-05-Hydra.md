## Hydra

Using Hydra is a unique experience. In some ways I feel like it is simpler than p5.js and in some other ways it is harder. The easy thing about Hydra is that there are a very few functions that can create a lot of interesting outputs the hard thing about Hydra is that those few functions are a bit hard to understand. When I tried to create my own Hydra image I only used three functions but it still created a very interesting image which was very interesting.

After that I tried to find interesting images using the shuffle feature and scrambling the values with the dice feature and I found some very interesting animations that were very interesting.
