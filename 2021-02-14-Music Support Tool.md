## Music Support Tool
# Idea

When I think of software/A.I generated artwork, the image that comes to my mind is music creation. I would initially design the program that depends heavily on randomness. It would consists of functions which would produce various sounds with different frequencies, beats, etc.. Then I would take these samples and try and stitch the different sounds together to make music. Then after I get a few good sounding sounds I would feed them back into the tool but this time I would re-design the tool to take the sounds I selected and generate similar sounds.

I know this seems a like a big task but if I narrow my program to just make different beats I think it would be doable.
